# A basic Twitter Stream processor

This is just a basic app that reads from the Twitter sample stream, tracking a variety of stats

To work properly, you'll need a file located at $HOME/.twitter/tweet-er-er containing 4 lines, with each line containing the values (in this order): consumer key, consumer secret, token key, & token secret.
